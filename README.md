# 🧰 Athena Resource Tool

Hello and thanks for your interest in our web app.

This tool can be used to search for technical resource links, add those links to the favourites section that you find most useful, delete those you don't find useful and add links that you do.

</br>

# 🧰 My Contributions To The Project

On this project I worked as a team with 4 others in an agile way, leading the stand ups and retros every day, using a Trello board to do it, created the documentation for this project , I created some of the React components and some of the CRUD routes on the backend, I also was able to implement React Testing Library files to test many of the components.

## 🔑 Environment Variables

</br>

To run the back end repo of this project, you will need to add your own credentials from the database you're using to draw from. (e.g.: Heroku)

In your .env file, you'll need to use the following format.

```

PGHOST=

PGUSER=

PGDATABASE=

PGPASSWORD=

PGPORT=

```

</br>

After this, first run the create table script in the terminal.

```
npm run db:createTable
```

Next, populate the table with the data from the libs folder with the following script.

```
npm run db:populateTable
```

If you'd like to drop the table completely, run the following script:

```
npm run db:dropTable

```

## 📚 API Reference

</br>

### To GET All Resources:

</br>

GET http://localhost:3001/resources/

This returns the entire contents of the database.

</br>

### To GET Resources by ID:

</br>

GET http://localhost:3001/resources/{id}

e.g. GET http://localhost:3001/resources/4

</br>

This returns:

```
 {

"success": true,

 "payload": [
     {
         "id": 4,
         "url": "https://linguinecode.com/post/react-usereducer-vs-usestate",
         "title": "React useReducer vs React useState: When to use one over the other?",
         "type": "Article",
         "topic": "React",
         "description": "An article about what React.useReducer is used for, and when to use it instead ofReact.useState"
         "isFavourite": "false"
     }
 ]

}
```

</br>

The value of isFavourite is a string instead of a boolean.

### To GET Resources by title:

</br>

GET http://localhost:3001/resources?title=value

</br>

e.g. GET http://localhost:3001/resources?title=react

</br>

This returns:

```
{

    "success": true,
    "payload": [
        {
            "id": 2,
            "url": "https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/cheatsheet/",
            "title": "A cheatsheet for the React Testing Library",
            "type": "Documentation",
            "topic": "React",
            "description": "A short guide to all the exported functions in React Testing Library"
            "isFavourite": "false"
        },
        {
            "id": 4,
            "url": "https://linguinecode.com/post/react-usereducer-vs-usestate",
            "title": "React useReducer vs React useState: When to use one over the other?",
            "type": "Article",
            "topic": "React",
            "description": "An article about what React.useReducer is used for, and when to use it instead ofReact.useState"
            "isFavourite": "false"
        }
    ]
}
```

### To Add To Database:

</br>

```

{

"url": "newurl.com",

"title": "A Title",

"type": "A Type",

"topic": "A Topic",

"description": "Your description here."

}

```

The value of id is automatically set and the value of isFavourite is automatically set to "false"

</br>

### To Update Database:

</br>

</br>

e.g. PUT http://localhost:3001/resources/5

Update using an object with this structure:

```

{

"title": "A Title",

"type": "A Type",

"topic": "A Topic",

"description": "Your description here."

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

</br>

Teamwork makes the dream work..

</br>

Break down every problem and then do it again and again..

</br>

Standups and Retros really helped us keep a great rhythm and revise our plan incrementally..

</br>

Keep open communication and share the problems you have when needed, we’re better together..

</br>

Take your breaks after the mini sprints, stay hydrated and encourage everyone to take a break from the screen..

</br>

Let things go if need be.. Sometimes it’s just not worth it..
